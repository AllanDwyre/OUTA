OUTA *Once Upon a Time an Astronaut*
---

it's a **game project**, where i worked on a procedural level generation.
Now it's a dead project, but i learnt about code architecture and game phycics. 

May be one day i will restart from scratch this project. For now i want to focus on somethings than game developpement.

thanks everyone, bye ðŸ¤™
